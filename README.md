# Wigxel Vanilla JS **Mini Tasks** :smile:

This test is meant to help you through hints develop algorithms from
the following comments on any task document. From these comments
you'll have to thinking of the best way possible to complete the task
given to you.

Every task here requires basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, or atleast
some experience with Javascript fundamentals. If you don't have any of
those, then am afraid the test may be quite confusing.

## Getting Started
Fork this repo by clicking on the `fork` button at the right top of this page before you begin.

Every task has a relative `readme` file containing instructions for that task. 
We recommend you use the Visual Studio text editor for all tasks, if you are a *newbie*.

#### Live reload
Install the VSCode extension `live server` for live reload while working on the task.

> If you notice a typo, don't hesitate to create an `issue` from the `issues` tab next to the `code` tab.

Have fun! :guitar:
